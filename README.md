# Ozone Generator IoT System

This project controls and monitors ozone levels using an ESP32 microcontroller and a Flutter-based mobile app.

## Structure

- `esp01/`: Code for ESP-01 module (Wi-Fi only)
- `esp32/f_to_e_v7_3/`: Firmware for ESP32 version 7.3 (Arduino code)
- `flutter_app/f_to_e_v7_4/`: Flutter app version 7.4 to control ozone device

## Features

- Real-time ozone monitoring
- BLE/Wi-Fi control (slider, relay, fan)
- ESP32-based firmware and cross-platform mobile interface
